# Comparison of the effectiveness of car safety system algorithms in the Unity environment
 The thesis focuses on the implementation and comparison of the effectiveness of algorithms used in car safety systems simulated in the Unity environment. The comparison will include a deterministic algorithm written using C# scripts and a machine learning model developed through the ML-Agents library. Simulation scenarios will also be designed to test different situations and conditions commonly encountered in real-world safety system tests. The results of the comparative analysis aim to distinguish the features of the presented solutions and determine which one is better suited for implementing an actual safety system.
